## About:
A cyber security blog by a pentester. I'll be sharing insights on the technologies, and tools that I experience within IT and cybersecurity.

## Purpose of this blog: 
Most of what I learnt throughout my journey is from open-source tools, blogs, and YouTube videos. I take good notes but I always had an excuse not to share. It's either because I don't like to be known or I want it to sound better/clearer. 

I am going to update this site at least once a week with something I learnt or something I will be learning that is related to IT or cybersecurity. It may not sound good enough but it will be as I keep writing and sharing. 

This is my way of thanking all those who have shared what they've learned.
