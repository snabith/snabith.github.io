A periodic review should help.

- This page serves as a guide to what one can learn from this site.

## Series list:
### Homelab series
- Use VMware to set up a virtual lab environment.
    - Learn how to set up the networks, install a firewall, set the firewall rules, install multiple operating systems, host a web server, set up a virtual router, and enable port-forwarding to simulate an attack.
- Perform your first attack: recon > scan > initial access > recon > escalate privileges > set up persistence.
- Learn about data exfiltration using DNS and maintaining persistence using DNS-based command center.
    - Set up an authoritative DNS server using digitaloceans.
- Packet capture and traffic analysis. 
- Active directory pentesting resources.
- Recommendations, and takeaways from the series. 

### Network security series
- Network security concepts.
- Common attacks at each layer.
- DNS, attacks against DNS, DNSSEC, and short notes on BGP security properties.
- How a TLS session is established.
